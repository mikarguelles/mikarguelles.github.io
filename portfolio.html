              I developed my Master Thesis project under the department of R&D at Saint-Gobain Ecophon AB, Hyllinge, Sweden.
              <br><br>
              It consists on a prototype for an automated adaptable acoustic panel capable of changing the acoustic properties of a room.
              I followed the Design Thinking methodology, came up with the requirements and developed multiple concepts.
              Once the alternatives were analysed one was selected and the detailed design was developed.
              <br><br>
              The programming and assembly were performed simultaneously and when software and hardware were integrated a debugging phase took place.
              When the prototype was correctly functioning, some acoustic measurements were recorded both in a semi-anechoic room and in a reverberant room.
              Both Speech Clarity (C50) and Reverberation Time (T60) were measured.
              <br><br>
              Finally, the data could be analysed and it was proven that the acoustic properties of the room were being manipulated by the panel.

              As part of the course "Service Robotics", LTH Lund University, my team developed this maze solving and rescue robot.
              <br><br>
              The main goal of this project was to build a robot capable of rescuing 3 cylinders that were lost inside a maze and take them out as fast as possible.
              <br><br>
              It's an Arduino based mobile robot with two 360 servo motors for the movement and three 180 servo motors for the gripping and lifting mechanism.
              With the help of 5 Infrared and 3 ultrasonic sensors the robot could navigate a maze.
              <br><br>
              The team of 4 was divided in two subgroups, electromechanical and software.
              The first team was focused on the design and manufacture of the robot and the second one on the maze solving algorithm.

              As part of the course "Packaging Technology & Development", LTH Lund University, my team developed this packaging solution for a refillable soap container.
              <br><br>
              This project was a collaboration with the company Under Your Skin, a swedish company that sells organic and vegan skincare products.
              They asked us to develop a quicker and cleaner solution for the refill process of their products.
              <br><br>
              Luxury hotels committed to the environment that are currently using big 500ml soap containers find it inconvinient and messy.
              Also, it takes too much time for the cleanning personnel.
              <br><br>
              We performed a series of interviews and surveys to multiple hotel managers and cleanning personnel in the Lund area.
              After assesing the necesities and minimum requirements for the different stakeholders we brainstormed different solutions.
              <br><br>
              We came up with a two stage refill system. First, the hotels could buy the bulkier and easy to transport prismatic 10l containers.
              A second 1l container can then be transported through the rooms by the cleanning personnel to refill the containers in the guests bathrooms.
              <br><br>
              The upside down container allows for an easier and less messy refill because it has a bigger opening that is not in contact with the product inside as opposed to regular designs.

              As part of the course "Product Design for everyday life", ETSII UPM, my team developed this pair of fair stands.
              The goal of the course was to design and manufacture stands for a project fair which was held at the end of the academic year.
              <br><br>
              Following the Design Thinking methodology, we developed the CAD models and after multiple iterations regarding mechanical considerations we manufactured them with a laser cutter.
              <br><br>
              We created two concepts: ARCADE and THE ARCH. ARCADE was designed for the exhibition of videogames and simulations our classmates had developed. On the other hand, THE ARCH held a couple of laser technology based machines.

              I developed my Bachelor Thesis under the Centre for Automation and Robotics (CAR) at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM).
              The project consisted on the comparison of several technologies for robotic grippers based on soft robotics.
              <br><br>
              To obtain a broad perspective I decided on developing two pneumatic grippers and two electromechanical ones.
              <br><br>
              The first pneumatic gripper one uses a vacuum and compressed air to open and close its four fingers respectively. The bellows in the silicone fingers generate these configurations when air is pushed or pulled from them.
              <br><br>
              The second one uses the jamming of a granular material inside a balloon to first adapt to a geometry and then "solidify" the gripper in that particular configuration.
              <br><br>
              The first electromechanical gripper consists of three cable actuated rigid fingers which for a specific cable length can adopt different configurations.
              <br><br>
              The second one, and the one that presented the best results, consisted on those three flexible fingers. When they are pressed into an object they curve and press against it.
              <br><br>
              After the design phase I manufactured the grippers using a 3D printer for most of the parts. The orange parts were printed with PLA, a rigid plastic, the blue fingers were printed with a flexible plastic and finally the silicone fingers
              were moulded from a 3D printed mould.
              <br><br>
              To compare their behaviour a series of tests were designed. For twelve objects that varied in size, shape and material the grippers tried to hold them and move them 50cm. Also, three environments were simulated: normal, wet and dusty.
              The pick and place operation was done 20 times for each object, gripper and environment which amounted to a total of 2.880 repetitions.
              To automate the testing process the Universal Robots 3 (UR3) was used in a supervised loop.
